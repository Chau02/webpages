    <h2>Welcome to Chau's Independent Assignment</h2>
    <!-- 2 completeted above -->
    
    <p style="color:black"> My name is <em>Anderson Chau</em> and I will hopefully <ins>graduate in 2024 but maybe in 2023</ins> 
    if all goes well. I will major in computer science because I like programming and I 
    believe the opportunities that technology will provide will allow me to have a fun and 
    fruitful life. What I like most about the major is how I can create <strong>almost anything
    </strong>I put my mind to and that the choices are endless when I programm. Programming 
    allows me to combine both critical thinking and creativity into a creation that will
    help all kinds of people.</p>
    <br />
    <p style="color:#ff5050;font-size:46px;font-family:Time;text-allign:right">My previous 
    jobs include working at Chick-Fil-A and then at a salad place called Chopt. It was fun 
    because I got to meet countless people that I would have never met and made friends 
    that had made me mature and happy. Right now, I am jobless but I plan to get an 
    internship somewhere that I can program. My dream job is to work for a company 
    produce a fully functioning AI that has the capability of a human. I want to create a 
    real life Cortana from Halo, but not the Terminator because that would then be the end 
    of the world and that is a no no. So, let's hope my dream job doesn't go like the 
    Terminator...</p>
